# getting-and-cleaning-data-final-project
This repo contains all required elements of the final project of the "getting and cleaning data" coursera course. 

Step 1: This step reads in the data from both tables and merges it into one dataset for future analysis. 

Step 2: This step reads in all features and only retains features that are either means or standard deviations. 

Step 3: This step applies activity labels to the data set. 

Step 4: This step makes a list of column names and then "tidies" the list up for future clarity and ease of use in future analyses. 

Step 5: This step calculates the means and standard deviations for all combinations of label and subject. It then writes the results to the file "finalresults.txt"
